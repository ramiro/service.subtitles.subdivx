0.0.5
- Add first setting: Show uploader name in place of language
  Being a spanish subtitles site, there is no point in showing the spanish
  flag and literal in the first column so we put that spot of the screen to
  better use: There are some renowned uploaders in the Subdivx.community and,
  for lack of more structured information in Subdivx, it can be a very
  important piece of information when it comes to choosing from several
  subtitles. Show his/her nick there.
  Initially the value of the setting is False. We'll see if it's worth
  changing it to True in some future release.
- Bullet-proof .rar uncompression as it's a popular file format on subdivx.com
